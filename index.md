# Welcome to the Glimesh Community Team (GCT)

We're glad you're here!  This training covers the different systems we use to support the Glimesh community and to keep Glimesh a safe place.  We have 3 main systems that we use;

| System Name | Description                                                                                                  | Expert                 | User Guide                                                                                     |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Discord     | Used to interact with both our users and contributors as well as other members of the GCT                    | Paco1342, Ember, Heiwa | [View](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045138571-Beginner-s-Guide-to-Discord) |
| GCT Dash    | The dashboard we use to view and edit user/channel information and take action on reports                    | mja00                  | [View](dash\)                                                                                  |
| Glimcare    | Used to respond to user emails and maintain the Knowledge Base/Glimesh Support Portal (support.glimesh.tv)   | MoltenLlama            | [View](glimcare\)                                                                              |

The Dash and Glimcare are still being developed, so the screenshots and information in these guides may be out of date.  If you find something that needs updating, feel free to fix it.  If you don't have access or aren't familar with editing pages on Github, ask for help in the Discord or have a chat with your Lead.

If you have any questions or access issues, ask for help in Discord, or if you get stuck, contact one of the experts listed above.

# Discord

We use both the Glimesh public Discord server and an invite only GCT Discord Server. 

The public Discord is where we assist and hang out with the Glimesh community members and other contributors, while the GCT Discord is usually very focused and used for discussing current platform issues, bans etc.

```markdown
Haven't received an invite to the GCT Discord as yet?
Just let your Team Lead know and they'll get you in!
```

Discord is very common in the industry, and we assume that most new GCT members will already be familiar with how to use it.  If you ever need a refresher, there's a great guide on the Discord Support Site linked in the table above.

# GCT Dash

The Dash is one of the main tools used by the GCT.  It enables us to view/edit user and channel information and manage platform bans.  Access is restricted to GCT members only and all usage is logged for auditing. NOTE: you'll need to make sure you have 2 Factor Authentication enabled on your account to be able to access the Dash.  Check out the user guide, linked above, if you'd like to know more.

# Glimcare

Glimcare is the system we use to manage incoming support emails, maintain the [support.glimesh.tv](https://support.glimesh.tv) site and also our own internal knowledge base.  It's based off the open source software called Zammad, so if you've used zammad or other similar ticketing sytems before (Zendesk, Freshdesk, Jira SD) you should find it quite easy to pick up.  For more information on Glimcare, check out the guide above.

# Feedback

Please let me know via Discord DM if you find any errors or have any feedback about this document.  

Cheers!
