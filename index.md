# Welcome to the Glimesh Community Team (GCT)

We're glad you're here!  This training covers the different systems we use to support the Glimesh community and keep to Glimesh a safe place.  We have 3 main system that we use;

| System Name | Description                                                                                                            | Expert                 |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| Discord     | Used to interact with both our users and contributors as well as other members of the GCT                              | Paco1342, Ember, Heiwa |
| GCT Dash    | The dashboard we use to view and edit user/channel information and take action on reports                              | mja00                  |
| Glimcare    | Used to respond to user emails, search the knowledge base and maintain the Glimesh Support Portal (support.glimesh.tv) | MoltenLlama            |

The Dash and Glimcare are still being developed, so the screenshots and information below may be out of date.  If you find something that needs updating, feel free to fix it.  If you don't have access or aren't familar with editing pages on Github, ask for help in the Discord or have a chat with your Lead.

## Discord

We use both the Glimesh public Discord server and an invite only GCT Discord Server. 

The public Discord is where we assist and hang out with the Glimesh community members and other contributors, while the GCT Discord is usually very focused and used for discussing current platform issues, bans etc.

```markdown
If you haven't received an invite to the GCT Discord as yet, 
just let your Team Lead know and they'll get you in.
```

Discord is very common in the industry, and we assume that most new GCT members will already be familiar with how to use it.  If you ever need a refresher, there's a great guide on the Discord Support Site -> [Discord Beginner Guide](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045138571-Beginner-s-Guide-to-Discord)
