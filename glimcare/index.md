# Tickets

## What exactly is a ticket?
In Glimcare, tickets are used to track customer service requests. The first time a customer emails us about something, Glimcare creates a new ticket. Each message sent between you and the customer is added to that ticket until the issue is resolved, the customer is happy, and the ticket is closed.

We also use Glimcare tickets to manage reports coming in via the report button on channels and user profiles.

So in a basic sense, a ticket is a thread of messages between you and a customer about a single issue.

## Why use a ticketing system?
Using a ticket system rather than just use email allows us to organize and catalog a high volume of support requests, which will be important as Glimesh grows. We can easily manage multiple tickets at once because each ticket is labeled and can be prioritized by its urgency. This will also come in handy when we deal with critical situations where users are filing large amounts of support tickets regarding a specific issue. A ticketing system helps us identify and segment these cases so that a designated task force can quickly address them in bulk.

Another benefit of the ticketing system is the centralization of information. The tickets are all stored in on system that can be searched and referenced for future cases. Not only does that help with customer service analytics, but GCT members can also use it to look up past cases that may have a solution related to their present problem.
